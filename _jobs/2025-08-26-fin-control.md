## About Bind
Bind is a newly launched not-for-profit Focused Research Organisation (FRO) based in London. Our mission is to make disordered proteins - long considered “undruggable” - treatable. We are combining high-throughput biology, engineering, and AI to generate new drug leads, build public datasets, and create tools to accelerate therapeutic discovery for diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. 

We are at an exciting early stage – setting up labs, onboarding our first scientists and laying out the operational and financial foundations. We’re looking for someone to help us run fast, stay on top of the numbers, and future-proof our processes.

## The Role
We are looking for a proactive, detail-driven Financial Controller to accelerate our financial reporting and build out our capabilities during this critical early phase and beyond. This is a hands-on role for someone who thrives on building and optimising financial processes and systems, working collaboratively with a multi-disciplinary team, and bringing clarity to a fast-moving innovative environment. You will report directly to the CFO and work closely with them to ensure Bind’s financial operations, from budgeting to reporting, are robust and effective. Your ability to balance speed and pragmatism with sound financial practices will be essential for our success.

## Who You Are
- **Team player.** You appreciate that in a small organisation, you may need to roll your sleeves up and get stuck in. 
- **More than just the numbers.** You like working with numbers, but understand how to bring meaning to them and use them to tell a story. 
- **Process-savvy, but flexible.** You bring order to chaos, but you are able to be pragmatic and adapt. 
- **A clear communicator.** You present well to different audiences, know how to avoid the jargon and write crisply. You take people on the journey with you. 
- **Problem solver.** You thrive in coming up with solutions and thinking outside the box.  
- **Technically strong.** We don’t mind which route you’ve taken to get to where you are, but you know your stuff and are most likely to be a few years post qualification (ACA, ACCA, CIMA).  
- **Experienced in biotech, life sciences, research operations, or startups** - but we’re open-minded for the right candidate. This might be your first step up to a financial controller role but you’re ready for the challenge.
