## Role Overview
We are seeking a highly motivated Research Assistant to join our interdisciplinary team focused on drug discovery for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). In this role, you will support innovative research programs within our biochemistry laboratory dedicated to the development of methods for screening and characterizing molecular interactions of small molecules with disordered protein targets. Working closely with senior scientists, you will support general laboratory operations and contribute to the production of proteins used in downstream assays for compound screening and structural or biophysical analyses. This is a unique and exciting opportunity to be a part of a growing not-for-profit research organisation dedicated to making disordered proteins druggable and thereby unlocking new therapeutic avenues.

## Key Responsibilities
### Reagent Preparation
- Prepare laboratory buffers and stock solutions 
- Prepare culture media, including media for isotopically labelled expression of proteins 
- Coordinate autoclaving of media and buffers with the building services 
- Perform labelling of proteins and reagents, for example with fluorescent tags 

### Laboratory operations
- Manage laboratory logistics, including coordinating deliveries, waste management and relationship with building management 
- Maintain reagent stock levels, place orders, and ensure a smooth supply of reagent and consumables in the lab 
- Assist with laboratory safety practices and surveillance 
- Maintain up to date safety documentation 
- Perform routine equipment maintenance including centrifuges, pH meter calibration, AKTA FPLC systems  
- Coordinate the preparation and shipment of samples to external facilities and collaborators 

### Protein Production
- Produce and maintain plasmid DNA and competent cell stocks 
- Undertake expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli 
- Evaluate protein quality using analytical methods such as SDS-PAGE,UV-Vis spectroscopy and size-based measurements  
- Purify proteins using established protocols including affinity, ion exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography on an AKTA FPLC 

### Team Collaboration
- Work closely with scientists and other team members to provide high quality samples and reagents for biochemical or biophysical assays 
- Support the management of wet lab operations and contribute to continuous process improvements 
- Maintain accurate and well-organised documentation of results, protocols, and reagent inventories 

Thrive in a dynamic, start-up-style environment where initiative and flexibility in your role are valued.

- Experience of producing isotopically labelled samples for NMR studies 
- Experience in coordinating laboratory deliveries and managing reagent inventories to support ongoing research operations 

## Who You Are
- **Team player.** You appreciate that in a small organisation, you may need to roll your sleeves up and get stuck in. 
- **More than just the numbers.** You like working with numbers, but understand how to bring meaning to them and use them to tell a story. 
- **Process-savvy, but flexible.** You bring order to chaos, but you are able to be pragmatic and adapt. 
- **A clear communicator.** You present well to different audiences, know how to avoid the jargon and write crisply. You take people on the journey with you. 
- **Problem solver.** You thrive in coming up with solutions and thinking outside the box.  
- **Technically strong.** We don’t mind which route you’ve taken to get to where you are, but you know your stuff and are most likely to be a few years post qualification (ACA, ACCA, CIMA).  
- **Experienced in biotech, life sciences, research operations, or startups** - but we’re open-minded for the right candidate. This might be your first step up to a financial controller role but you’re ready for the challenge.
