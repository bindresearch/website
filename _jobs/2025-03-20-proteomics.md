## About Bind Research
Bind Research is an innovative not-for-profit research organisation at the forefront of developing tools and datasets to characterise small-molecule interactions with intrinsically disordered proteins. Based in central London, Bind leverages interdisciplinary methods spanning chemoproteomics, experimental biophysics (NMR spectroscopy), and computational approaches. You will play a crucial role in shaping the future of this cutting-edge research initiative from the beginning. 

Join Bind Research to push the limits of drug discovery for intrinsically disordered proteins through large-scale chemoproteomics, experimental biophysics, and AI-driven ligand prediction.

## Role Overview
We are seeking a Senior Scientist in Chemoproteomics to lead, develop, implement, and optimise cutting-edge experimental methods for mapping proteome-wide small-molecule interactions. The successful candidate will design and execute high-throughput chemoproteomics experiments, work closely with a strong AI team to develop predictive models, and contribute to the creation of an interactive platform to share and analyse proteome-wide interaction data. 

### Key Responsibilities
1. **Chemoproteomics Strategy & Experimental Execution**
- Develop and optimise chemical proteomics workflows for large-scale identification of small-molecule interactions with intrinsically disordered proteins. 
- Apply photoreactive and bioorthogonal probes to map interactions in intact cells. 
- Utilise quantitative mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, TMT-based proteomics) to analyse small-molecule–protein interactions. 
- Expand fragment-based ligand discovery (FBLD) approaches to intrinsically disordered and challenging proteins. 
2. **Driving innovation**
- Stay up to date with advancements in chemoproteomics, disordered proteins, and mass spectrometry, and translate these developments into novel experimental and analytical approaches. 
- Contribute to the design and execution of innovative mass spec-based research projects, particularly through the integration of AI and mass spec methodologies to advance Bind’s scientific objectives. 
3. **Team Collaboration and Training**
- Collaborate with computational scientists to build a predictive ligand discovery platform. 
- Mentor and support Bind’s interdisciplinary team in experimental design, execution, and data interpretation. 
- Train team members in chemoproteomics workflows, mass spectrometry techniques, and analysis. 
4. **Capability & Infrastructure Development**
- Establish and manage collaborations with external mass spectrometry labs in Central London, ensuring seamless access to off-site proteomics workflows. 
- Serve as the primary liaison for mass spec facility partnerships, coordinating sample preparation, data acquisition, and analysis with external teams.

## Qualifications and Expertise
### Education 
- PhD in Biology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, or a related field with a specialisation in (chemo-)proteomics and/or mass spectrometry. 

### Skills and Experience 
- Hands-on experience with quantitative proteomics (TMT, SILAC, label-free quantification) and LC-MS/MS methods. 
- Expertise in photoaffinity labelling, bioorthogonal chemistry, and fragment-based ligand discovery (FBLD). 
- Experience with small-molecule screening approaches for protein interaction studies. 
- Expertise in mass spectrometry data processing pipelines (MaxQuant, Proteome Discoverer). 
- Experience integrating multi-omics datasets. 

### Nice to have 
- Python programming skills (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas). 
- Experience working with intrinsically disordered proteins. 
- Experience working with data visualisation software (Perseus) 

### Additional Attributes 
- A creative mindset with a passion for advancing mass spectrometry. 
- Enthusiasm for training and mentoring team members at all levels of mass spec expertise. 
- A collaborative approach, with a willingness to engage in team-based research initiatives. 
- Commitment to continuous professional development in mass spec. 
- Passion for contributing to the establishment and growth of a world-class research organisation.
