## About Bind
Bind is a newly launched not-for-profit Focused Research Organisation (FRO) based in London. Our mission is to make disordered proteins—long considered "undruggable"—treatable. We are combining high-throughput biology, engineering, and AI to generate new drug leads, build public datasets, and create tools to accelerate therapeutic discovery for diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration.

We are currently in an exciting build phase—setting up labs, onboarding our first scientists, and finalising operational foundations. We're looking for someone to help us run fast, stay organised, and build well.

## The Role
We’re looking for a proactive, detail-driven Director of Operations to help drive execution during this critical early phase. This is a hands-on role for someone who thrives on making systems work, solving operational challenges, and bringing clarity and structure to a fast-moving environment. You’ll work closely with the CEO and wider Senior Leadership Team to ensure Bind functions smoothly across its physical, digital, and human infrastructure. A Delivery Manager will report directly into this role, supporting execution and helping translate strategic goals into effective, on-the-ground operations.

- **A clear communicator.** You write crisply, delegate well, and keep people aligned.
- **Mission-aligned.** You’re energised by science, public good, and building something that matters.
- **Experienced** in biotech, life sciences, research operations, or startup buildouts—but we're open-minded for the right operator.
