## Role Overview
We are seeking a highly motivated Biochemist/Biophysicist to join our interdisciplinary team focused on drug discovery for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). This role is ideal for a scientist with expertise in protein production, purification, and biophysical characterization, who is eager to apply their skills to a challenging and cutting-edge research area. Collaboration is at the heart of this role—you will work closely with experimental and computational scientists to integrate findings and develop new hypotheses. We are looking for a scientist with strong technical expertise, problem-solving ability, and a passion for advancing IDP-targeted drug discovery. This is an exciting opportunity to contribute to a growing not-for-profit research organisation dedicated to making IDPs druggable.

### Key Responsibilities
1. **Protein Production Purification and Optimisation**
- Express and purify IDPs using recombinant expression systems
- Optimise protein production, purification, and labelling strategies to enable high quality biophysical characterisation

2. **Biophysical Characterisation of disordered-small molecule interactions**
- Apply biophysical techniques (e.g., NMR, circular dichroism, fluorescence-based methods) to characterise interactions between IDPs and small molecules.
- Contribute to the development of high-throughput workflows for screening small-molecule interactions with IDPs.

3. **Team Collaboration**
- Work closely with experimental and computational scientists to develop and test new hypotheses and integrate experimental data with in-silico approaches.
- Support the management of wet lab operations.
- Maintain accurate and well-organised documentation of experiments, protocols, and results.

4. **Driving Innovation**
- Stay up to date with advancements in IDP research and emerging techniques for characterising their interactions.

We value diverse perspectives and welcome candidates from both academic and industry backgrounds.

### Education and Experience
- Ph.D. or equivalent experience in Biochemistry, Biophysics, Structural Biology, Molecular Biology, or a related field.
- Hands-on experience with one or more biophysical techniques relevant to intrinsically disordered proteins and drug discovery (e.g., NMR, CD, SPR, BLI).
- Experience working with high-throughput screening methods.

### Skills and Abilities
- Strong written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to communicate effectively with team members in diverse fields.
- Strong expertise in recombinant protein expression, purification, and characterisation.

### Additional Attributes
- Collaborative and interdisciplinary spirit with a strong willingness to engage in team-based research initiatives.
- Dedication to continuous professional development in biochemical/biophysical methods relevant to intrinsically disordered proteins.
- Passion for contributing to the establishment and growth of a world-class not-for-profit research organisation.

### Nice to have
- Experience with cell-based assays for assessing the functional impact of small-molecule drugs.
- Programming skills for data analysis (e.g. Python) to support biophysical data interpretation and workflow automation.
- Experience of producing isotopically labelled samples for NMR studies.
