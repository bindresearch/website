## Role Overview
We are seeking a Scientific Software Engineer to develop computational and modelling capabilities at Bind. This role includes developing new simulation protocols and models using best practices in software engineering and scientific reproducibility, large-scale data curation, contributing to open-source software, and system administration.

### Key Responsibilities
1. **Software Development**
- Develop innovative simulation protocols and pipelines to elucidate and quantify the binding interactions between small molecules and intrinsically disordered proteins.
- Enhance the usability of simulation methods by implementing automated, streamlined, and efficient software solutions in line with best practices in software engineering.
- Setup and maintain databases of interactions of small molecules and intrinsically disordered proteins and make them accessible to other team members.

2. **System Administration**
- Setup locally-hosted tools and maintain compute systems.
- Develop interfaces to high-performance compute and cloud resources.

3. **Team Collaboration**
- Collaborate closely with other computational team members and experimental biophysicists, assisting others with software development tasks.
- Mentor and support Bind’s interdisciplinary team in computational methods and software engineering.

4. **Driving Innovation**
- Stay current with new developments in software engineering, biomolecular simulation, deep learning, and computational technologies.
- Contribute to the design and execution of cutting-edge simulation-based research projects that advance Bind’s scientific mission.
