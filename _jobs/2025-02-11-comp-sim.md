## Role Overview
We are seeking a Scientist to advance computational and modelling capabilities at Bind. This role includes developing new simulation protocols, building both physics-based and machine-learning models, contributing to open-source software, and large-scale data analysis and curation.

### Key Responsibilities
1. **Protocol Development**
- Develop innovative simulation protocols to elucidate and quantify the binding interactions between small molecules and intrinsically disordered proteins
- Evaluate and advance methodologies for benchmarking and aligning simulations with experimental data
- Critically assess existing approaches using industry-leading benchmarking practices to identify areas for improvement
- Enhance the usability of simulation methods by implementing automated, streamlined, and efficient software solutions in line with best practices in software engineering.

2. **Model Development**
- Employ cutting edge techniques–including machine-learned force fields, coarse graining, and enhanced sampling–to create new predictive models
- Utilise active learning, Bayesian, and bootstrapping methods to achieve robust performance in low-data regimes

3. **Team Collaboration**
- Collaborate closely with other computational team members and experimental biophysicists, incorporating experimental data into modeling and protocol development
- Mentor and support Bind’s interdisciplinary team in computational methods and experimental design

4. **Driving Innovation**
- Stay current with breakthroughs in biomolecular simulation, deep learning, disordered proteins, and computational technologies
- Contribute to the design and execution of cutting-edge simulation-based research projects that advance Bind’s scientific mission.
