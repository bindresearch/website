# Vision
<b>Our vision is to map drug-binding capacities for disordered proteins, catalysing next-generation drug discovery.</b>

## How we are doing this
We are working to enable prediction of small-molecule binders from disordered protein sequences alone. We are first building a high-throughput, parallel platform (combining cellular and biophysical experiments, computation, and AI) to increase state-of-the-art screening efficiency to probe millions of small-molecule/disordered protein interactions. We will leverage this platform to create an enormous dataset and ultimately build an AI system that, given any disordered protein sequence, will predict promising drug candidates.

## A Focused Research Organisation
The scale of our science is bold, requiring a strong engineering focus, and is rooted in public benefit. To maximise impact, we have established Bind as a Focused Research Organisation (FRO, [Marblestone et al., Nature, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00018-5)), the first to be formed in the UK, to create high-impact tools and datasets. We are committed to sharing our output (tools, AI software and data) publicly, while also maximising translational impact by protecting IP of specific, potential drug molecules to ensure they can be developed into therapeutics and ultimately accessed by medical professionals and patients.
