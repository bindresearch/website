# Privacy Notice
*Edition date: 7th February 2025*

At Bind Research, we know that you take the privacy of your information and how it is used and shared very seriously and we will only use your personal information in accordance with the current data protection laws in the UK and this privacy notice. This notice describes our privacy policy and how we aim to repay the trust you have shown by sharing your personal data with us.
This policy applies to all the websites we operate, our use of emails and text messages for marketing purposes, and any other methods we use for collecting information. It covers what we collect, why we collect it, what we do with the information, what we won’t do with the information, and what rights you have.
This privacy policy only applies to personal information we hold about individuals.  It does not apply to information we hold about companies and other organisations.  
We may update this privacy policy from time to time by publishing the amended version on our website.  Following any changes, the date at the top of this notice will be updated.

## Who we are
In this policy, whenever you see the words (‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘our’), it refers to **Bind Research, Cannon Place, 78 Cannon Street, London, United Kingdom, EC4N 6AF. Registered in England Company No: 16175978**.  For the purposes of UK Data Protection Law, we are a data controller in respect of the personal information that we collect and process about you as described in this privacy policy.

## Information we collect
We will only ever collect the information we need – including data that will be useful to help improve our services.
We may collect and process the following data about you:
1. Personal information, such as name, postal address, phone number, email address, that you provide when you contact us via telephone or email and includes information provided when you
    - enquire about our scientific approach, organisational structure, or fundraising;
    - request information via telephone or email; or
    - request a call back.
2. Details of your visits to our site including but not limited to, IP addresses (the location of the computer on the internet), pages accessed and files downloaded. This helps us to determine how many people use our sites, how many people visit on a regular basis, and how popular our pages are. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns and does not identify any individual. It simply allows us to monitor and improve our service.

Our site uses cookies to provide you with a good experience when you browse our site and allows us to improve our site. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purpose for which we use them please see our cookie policy. If you want to disable cookies please refer to your browser help.

## How we use the information we collect
We may process your personal data for our legitimate business interests. “Legitimate Interests” means the interests of our organisation in conducting and managing our business and providing you with the best services in the most secure way. These interests include:
- To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.
- To provide you with information about our services or offers that you request from us. 
- To help us identify you when you contact or visit us.
- For general administration purposes.
- To help us improve the quality of our services
- When you communicate with us (e.g., by emails, phone calls, etc.), we retain such information and our responses to you in the records of your account.
When we process your personal data for our legitimate business interests, we always ensure that we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights under UK data protection laws. 
If you have any concerns about the processing described above, you have the right to object to this processing.  For more information on your rights please see “Your Rights” section below.

## Choice / opt-in and opt-out
Whenever the processing of your personal data requires your consent then you will be given the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out to having your contact details used as set out above, at the time your details are submitted.
If you no longer wish to receive marketing emails or other promotional materials from us, you may opt-out of receiving these communications at any time by one of the following methods:
- by replying to the email with ‘unsubscribe’ in the subject line;
- by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@bindresearch.org">info@bindresearch.org</a>.

## Sharing your information
Just like most other organisations, we work with third-party service providers which provide important functions to us, including email and mail distribution and IT services, that allow us to be easier, faster, and friendlier in the way we deliver our services.  
Where we use service providers, we will enter into appropriate contracts to ensure that we are able to exercise control over their access to, and use of, your personal information.
We may also disclose your personal information to third parties, if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data for legal or regulatory purposes.

## International Data Transfers
The parties mentioned above may be established in jurisdictions other than your own and outside the European Economic Area.  These countries do not always afford an equivalent level of privacy protection and where this is the case, we have taken specific steps based upon contractual protections, in accordance with EU and UK data protection law, to protect your personal data. 
Please <a href="mailto:info@bindresearch.org">contact us</a> for more information about this.

## Data security
Information is stored by us on computers located in the UK. We may transfer the information to other offices and to other reputable third-party organisations as explained above – they may be situated inside or outside the European Economic Area.  We may also store information in paper files.
We have security protocols and policies in place to manage and record your data privacy and preferences correctly and that your data is stored securely to protect against its loss, misuse and alteration. 
We take steps to ensure that any organisations that we share your data with will have security protocols and policies in place to manage and record your data privacy and preferences correctly and that your data is stored correctly.
Unfortunately, the transmission of data across the internet is not completely secure and whilst we do our best to try to protect the security of your information we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur whilst data is being transferred.
We will keep your information only for as long as we need it to provide you with the services or information you have required, to administer your relationship with us, to comply with the law, or to ensure we do not communicate with people that have asked us not to. When we no longer need information, we will always dispose of it securely, using specialist companies if necessary to do this work for us.

## Job applicants, current and former employees
When individuals apply to work for us, we will only use the information they supply to us to process their application and to monitor recruitment statistics. Where we want to disclose information to a third party, for example where we want to take up a reference or obtain a ‘disclosure’ from the Criminal Records Bureau, we will not do so without informing them beforehand unless the disclosure is required by law.

## Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be destroyed or deleted
Once a person has taken up employment with us, we will compile a file relating to their employment. The information contained in this will be kept secure and will only be used for purposes directly relevant to that person’s employment. Once their employment with us has ended, we will retain the file in accordance with the requirements of UK laws and then delete it.

## Your rights
Under the data protection legislation, you have the right to request copies of your data, request rectification of your data, request erasure of your data, object to us processing your data, the right to prevent your data being used for direct marketing, request us to restrict the processing of your data and where our systems allow, the right to access a copy of the information we hold about you (a subject access request).
If you wish to exercise any of these rights please contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:info@bindresearch.org">info@bindresearch.org</a>.
