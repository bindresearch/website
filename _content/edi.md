## 8. Making a complaint
### 8.1. Informal
Bind recognises that complaints regarding equality, diversity and inclusion can sometimes be of a sensitive or intimate nature and that it may not be appropriate for you to raise the issue through our normal grievance procedure. In such cases, you are encouraged to raise these issues with a colleague within the Senior Leadership Team of your choice, regardless of whether they have direct supervisory responsibility for you.  Bind external HR advisor should also be informed directly, this ensures confidentiality and support.

### 8.2. Formal
Where the informal approach fails or if the issue is more serious, you should bring the matter to the attention of the Head of Department as a formal written grievance and again the external HR advisor can assist you in this. If possible, you should keep notes of the situation so that the written complaint can include:

8.2.1. the name of the alleged harasser;

8.2.2. the nature of the alleged discrimination / harassment;

8.2.3. the dates and times when the alleged discrimination / harassment occurred;

8.2.4. the names of any witnesses; and

8.2.5. any action already taken by you to stop the alleged discrimination / harassment.

Where it is not possible to make a formal complaint to the relevant Head of Department or you do not feel comfortable doing so, for example where they are the alleged harasser, we would encourage you to raise your complaint directly to the People Team.

On receipt of a formal complaint, we will take action to separate you from the alleged harasser to enable an uninterrupted investigation to take place. This may involve a temporary transfer of the alleged harasser to another work area or suspension with contractual pay until the matter has been resolved.

On conclusion of the investigation, which will normally be within 10 days of the meeting with you, a report of the findings will be submitted to the manager who will hold the grievance meeting.

You will be invited to attend a meeting, at a reasonable time and location, to discuss the matter once the person hearing the grievance has had opportunity to read the report. You have the right to be accompanied at such a meeting by a colleague or a union representative (where relevant) and you must take all reasonable steps to attend. Those involved in the investigation will be expected to act in confidence and any breach of confidence will be a disciplinary matter.

You will be able to put your case forward at the meeting and the manager will explain the outcome of the investigation. You have a right to appeal the outcome, which is to be made to an appointed manager named in the outcome letter within 5 days of receiving the outcome.

If the decision is that the allegation is well founded, the harasser will be liable to disciplinary action in accordance with our disciplinary procedure up to and including dismissal.

Bind is committed to ensuring employees are not discouraged from using this procedure and no employee will be victimised for having brought a complaint.

## 9. Work-Life Balance and Organisational Culture
9.1. Bind supports a positive and inclusive culture that allows employees to balance professional and personal commitments. The Company provides flexible working arrangements where possible and encourages open discussion about adjustments that support family or caring responsibilities.
