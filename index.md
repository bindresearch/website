<p class="statement">Our mission is to make disordered proteins druggable.</p>

Many incurable diseases (cancer, neurodegeneration) involve disordered proteins. Considered ‘undruggable’ by the mainstream pharmaceutical industry, disordered proteins continuously change their three-dimensional shapes and lack long-lived sites to which drug-molecules can attach themselves. Our mission is to make disordered proteins druggable. We will screen millions of disordered protein/drug-molecule pairs to learn the rules of drugging disordered proteins. Building on our expertise and working with academic and industrial partners, we will leverage cutting-edge biology, engineering, and AI to deliver new drugs and tools. To accomplish this in a manner for maximum societal benefit, we will establish a Focused Research Organisation (FRO).

Bind is a finalist in the UK Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology (DSIT) Research Ventures Catalyst programme. We are seeking £15M from a variety of sources and 1:1 match funding from DSIT should we be successful in the Research Ventures Catalyst programme, up to a final total of £30M.
