<p class="subtitle">Our mission is to make disordered proteins druggable.</p>

<p class="statement">We are a UK-based not-for-profit Focused Research Organisation (FRO) committed to improving patient outcomes by turning disordered proteins into viable drug targets.</p>

Many incurable diseases (e.g., cancer, neurodegeneration) involve biomolecules called ‘disordered proteins’. Considered ‘undruggable’ by the mainstream pharmaceutical industry, disordered proteins continuously change their three-dimensional shapes and lack long-lived sites with which drug-molecules can interact. 

Our mission is to make disordered proteins druggable. We are screening millions of disordered protein/drug-molecule pairs to learn the rules of drugging disordered proteins.

Building on our expertise and working with academic and industrial partners, we are leveraging cutting-edge biology, engineering, and AI to deliver new drugs and tools. We are building comprehensive datasets of disordered protein-drug interactions to create public assets to fuel AI models and accelerate the discovery process. To accomplish this in a manner for maximum societal benefit, we have established a Focused Research Organisation (FRO), a fully-independent not-for-profit entity dedicated to this goal.
