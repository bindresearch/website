## Our vision
Our goal is to map drug-binding capacities for every disordered protein, thus catalysing next-generation drug discovery. 

## How we’ll do this
We aim to enable prediction of small-molecule binders from disordered protein sequences alone. We will first build a high-throughput, parallel platform (combining experiment, computation, and AI) to increase state-of-the-art screening efficiency to probe millions of small-molecule/disordered protein interactions. We will leverage this tool to create an enormous dataset and ultimately build an AI system that, given any disordered protein sequence, will predict promising drug candidates. 

### A Focused Research Organisation
Our mission—make disordered proteins druggable—and the scale of our science are bold, rooted in public good, and require a strong engineering focus without academic publishing nor industrial profit pressure. To maximise impact, we will create a UK-based FRO to achieve technical milestones (creation of high-impact tools, datasets) within 7 years. We are committed to sharing our work publicly (tools, AI software, data), while also maximising translational impact by protecting IP of specific therapeutic molecules to ensure they can be accessed by medical professionals/patients. Upon completion, we will have the tools/expertise to launch new, non-profit initiatives and/or start-ups.
