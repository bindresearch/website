Bind is a finalist in the UK Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology (DSIT) Research Ventures Catalyst programme! By making it through the first round, we received £70,000 in seed funding, which we are using to lay the foundation of a non-profit research institute to target disordered proteins. Successful proposals will be funded by up to £25M from the UK government with a philanthropic match.
