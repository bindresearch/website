We have welcomed a further four new team members this last month into pivotal roles for Bind. 

Dr Wendy Bushell has joined us as Director of Operations, bringing more than 15 years of leadership experience in UK and global biotech. We are excited by what Wendy will bring to Bind, with her deep expertise in scaling teams, establishing labs, and building the culture and systems that drive growth. Alex Messam has joined the team as Financial Controller, bringing with him excellent skills in financial reporting and developing finance systems and processes fit for a rapidly growing R&D team. Our laboratory team has expanded, with Anaïs Naretto joining the Biophysics team as Senior Scientist. Anaïs is an expert in producing challenging proteins and running the full suite of assays to test their interactions with small molecules.  Growing again, Ananth Kumar has also joined our Biophysics team as Senior Scientist, bringing deep expertise in protein–RNA interactions and the production of challenging protein complexes.

We’re excited to have them on board as we continue to grow and push the boundaries of drug discovery.
