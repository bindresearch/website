Over the last 3 months we are delighted to have welcomed five stellar new members of the team to Bind.

Dr Jasmine (Jaz) Cornish joined as Head of Protein and Drug Discovery, bringing deep expertise in disordered proteins and drug discovery. We’re excited for her to lead and shape our screening strategy. James Eaton came aboard as Scientist, Magnetic Resonance, adding essential method development skills to the team. His expertise in NMR will help push the throughput boundaries for this critical approach. Dr Sharna-kay Daley joined as Delivery Manager, bringing a sharp organisational mindset and scientific acumen to align execution with innovation as we scale. Most recently, Sören von Bülow joined as a Computational Scientist. Stephanie Pritchard has joined us as our EA & Office Manager, bringing nearly a decade of administrative experience supporting senior leaders across legal, not-for-profit, and corporate sectors. Sören is an expert in coarse-grained simulations of intrinsically disordered proteins and brings a wealth of expertise in computational modelling. We’re excited to continue to grow with such exceptional talent driving our mission forward to make disordered proteins druggable.
