It’s been an exciting week at Bind Research! We’re thrilled to welcome three exceptional people to the team. Dr Acely Garza-Garcia, an expert biochemist formerly at the Francis Crick Institute, joins us as Senior Scientist, Biochemistry and Biophysics. Her expertise will be instrumental in building our dataset and advancing our platform. Dr Candide Champion a talented computational chemist who recently completed his PhD at ETH Zurich, joins us as a Scientific Software Engineer. His deep knowledge of molecular modelling and software development is a fantastic addition to our capabilities. Sam Patterson is a bright undergraduate student at Duke University who is visiting Bind for the summer to learn about proteins, drug discovery, and startups. Welcome, Acely, Candide, and Sam! We’re so glad to have you on board!
