Bind is pitching in the UK Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology (DSIT) Research Ventures Catalyst programme at the Royal Society of Chemistry.

Success in the first round guarantees seed funding with which we can build a full proposal for a Focused Research Organisation with the mission of making intrinsically disordered proteins druggable. Successful proposals will be funded by up to Â£25M from the UK government with a philanthropic match.
