Bind has taken up a lease for 2,746 sq. ft of state-of-the-art lab and office space at the Apex Building, Tribeca. 
In the words of our CEO, Gabi Heller, “We’re excited to be joining the vibrant LBIC community at the Apex. This space offers the flexibility and infrastructure we need to build a world-class not-for-profit research organisation. For a mission like ours, namely transforming drug discovery for disordered proteins, it’s crucial to be embedded in an environment that fosters collaboration, innovation, and scientific excellence.”

Located in one of London's most vibrant innovation hubs, our new home positions us at the heart of the UK's thriving life sciences ecosystem, with excellent connectivity and access to world-class talent. The LBIC space offers us the specialized laboratory infrastructure needed to develop our high-throughput measurement platform and to house our growing team of world-class scientists and technologists.
