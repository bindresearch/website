name: Pijush Chakraborty, PhD
position: Senior Scientist, Magnetic Resonance
bio: "Dr Pijush Chakraborty is a structural biologist and biophysicist specialising in the molecular mechanisms of protein aggregation. His research has uncovered disease-specific amyloid structures associated with human tauopathies and revealed how post-translational modifications, molecular chaperones, and phase separation regulate the aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins such as tau and α-synuclein. Drawing on extensive expertise in NMR and other advanced biophysical techniques, Pijush has provided detailed structural insight into the formation and modulation of dynamic protein assemblies. At Bind, he will help build and apply pipelines to study IDP-small molecule interactions."
