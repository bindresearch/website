name: Pijush Chakraborty, PhD
position: Senior Scientist, Magnetic Resonance
bio: "Pijush Chakraborty is a structural biologist and biophysicist whose primary research interest is understanding the molecular mechanisms of protein aggregation. During his PhD, he established in vitro approaches to study tau protein aggregation and uncovered disease-specific amyloid structures associated with human tauopathies. His subsequent postdoctoral work revealed how post-translational modifications, molecular chaperones, and phase separation regulate the aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins such as tau and α-synuclein. Using advanced NMR spectroscopy and complementary biophysical techniques, Pijush has provided detailed structural insight into the formation and modulation of these dynamic protein assemblies. At Bind, Pijush will help build and apply pipelines to study IDP-small molecule interactions, drawing on his extensive expertise in working with disordered proteins."
