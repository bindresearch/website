name: James Eaton, PhD
position: Senior Scientist, Magnetic Resonance
bio: "James Eaton is a specialist in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. He has previously worked on NMR method development, data analysis and applications of NMR to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). At Bind, James is working on developing robust and efficient workflows for collecting and analysing NMR data on IDPs. These NMR methods provide high throughput, atom-specific characterisation of small molecule binding to IDPs, complementing the other biophysical and computational techniques at Bind."
