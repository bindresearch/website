bio: "Dr Hannah Kiely-Collins is a chemical biologist specialising in chemoproteomics and proximity-inducing modalities for 'undruggable' targets. Previously a Senior Scientist at the Francis Crick Institute, she contributed to translational projects spanning oncology, schizophrenia, and inflammatory bowel disease. Her broad experience working at the academia-industry interface and passion for chemoproteomics underpin her work at Bind, where she is building a chemoproteomics platform to enable IDP ligand discovery in native biological systems and collaborating closely with partners to enable the characterisation of IDP-small molecule interactions by mass spectrometry methods."
