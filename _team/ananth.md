name: Ananth Kumar, PhD
position: Senior Scientist, Biophysics
bio: "Studying dynamic protein complexes and nucleic acid machines are Ananth's primary interests. During his PhD, he visualised the architecture of mRNA 3′-end processing machinery, helping shed light on how gene expression is regulated. His subsequent postdoc work focussed on human non-coding RNAs and transcription factors. Ananth's entrepreneurial acumen has been recognized by his selection into the SYNC1.0 program and the Big if True Science fellowship. At Bind, Ananth will help build pipelines to study IDP-small molecule interactions, drawing on his earlier work on RNA-small molecules."
